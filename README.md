# agenda

A planner / agenda / to-do list with a loose, simple text format.

Items are added to a text file using the following Markdown-compatible format. This program parses the items and produces a summary of upcoming tasks.

```
# YYYY-MM-DD
* Start new essay
* 9:00-10:00 Meet with client
* 18:00 Movie time
Bullet points are optional (this is an item too!)
```

Items do not have a complete / incomplete state.
