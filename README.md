# agenda

A planner / agenda / to-do list with a loose, simple text format.

Items are added to a text file using the following Markdown-compatible format. This program parses the items and produces a summary of upcoming tasks. Lines that do not match the pattern are ignored.

```
* YYYY-MM-DD Start new essay

- YYYY-MM-DD 9:00-10:00 Meet with client
- YYYY-MM-DD 18:00 Movie time
```

Items do not have a complete / incomplete state.
